## Project Overview
The One City Festival Management System is a web-based platform developed using **C# .NET Framework**, **ASP.NET MVC**, **Firebase Authentication**, and **Firestore Cloudstore**. This system enables visitors to sign up for a festival, register for events, provide feedback, and allows administrators to manage the festival efficiently.

## Features

### Visitor Features:
1. **User Registration & Authentication:** Sign up and log in using Firebase Authentication.
2. **Festival Registration:** Join the festival as a visitor.
3. **RSVP for Events:** Register for available festival events (subject to attendee limits).
4. **Rate Events:** Provide a rating (1 to 5 stars) for attended events.
5. **Recommend Events:** Rate whether they would recommend an event to others (1 to 5 stars).
6. **Leave Comments:** Share feedback and comments about attended events.

### Administrator Features:
1. **Manage Events:** Create, edit, delete, and archive events.
2. **View Visitor List:** See all registered visitors attending the festival.
3. **Manage Event Attendance:** View RSVPs for each event.
4. **Dashboard & Reports:**
   - **Festival Dashboard:** Displays key visitor demographics (e.g., age, gender) and event statistics (e.g., attendance per event).
   - **Event Dashboard:** Displays event ratings, recommendations, comments, and visitor demographics for each event.

## Technologies Used
- **C# .NET Framework** (ASP.NET MVC) for backend development
- **Firebase Authentication** for user authentication
- **Firebase Firestore Cloudstore** for data storage and retrieval
- **Bootstrap & CSS** for responsive UI design

## Installation & Setup
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd OneCityFestival
   ```
2. **Open the project in Visual Studio.**
3. **Install Dependencies:** Ensure that required NuGet packages are installed.
4. **Set Up Firebase:**
   - Create a Firebase project.
   - Enable Authentication (Email/Password sign-in method).
   - Configure Firestore database with required collections.
   - Update Firebase configuration in the project.
5. **Run the Application:**
   - Set the startup project.
   - Press `Ctrl + F5` to start the application.

## Database Structure (Firestore Collections)
- **Users** (Stores visitor and admin details)
- **Events** (Stores event details, categories, and limits)
- **RSVPs** (Stores visitor registrations for events)
- **Feedback** (Stores event ratings, recommendations, and comments)

## Event Categories (Predefined)
1. Music & Concerts
2. Arts & Exhibitions
3. Food & Drink
4. Sports & Outdoor Activities
5. Workshops & Seminars

## Future Enhancement possibilities that I see viable
- Implement a **waiting list** for full events.
- Add **email notifications** for event reminders.
- Integrate **real-time updates** for RSVP status.
